    "### Approach\n",
    "The senior secondary achievements dataset was used to rank secondary schools based on study scores and completion percentages. For primary schools, a ranking was generated by comparing enrollment percentages relative to the population size of each suburb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled a suburb ranking based on educational institution counts and primary and secondary school rankings to create a comprehensive feature dataset. The final feature set integrates different facets of education within each suburb, providing holistic view of educational availability and is intended to be included as feautres for predictive model training.\n",

    "Visualizations and Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Education Density per kmÂ²: An interactive heatmap was created to visually represent the density of educational institutions across suburbs.\n",
    "Bar Charts for Clarity: To account for the different roles of primary and secondary schools, I generated three separate bar plots, focusing on:\n",
    "1. Suburb rankings by education density\n",
    "2. Suburb rankings by the number of top-ranking secondary schools\n",
    "3. Suburb rankings by primary school density\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 20 suburbs were highlighted in each plot as a metric to evaluate the performance across these three criteria. However, given the varying nature of educational stages, these rankings differ across plots. Ultimately, the objective is to identify 'high-performing' suburbs that excel in education density, primary school quantity, and secondary school rankings. \n",
    "The availability and quality of education are often key factors for families and renters when choosing a location.\n",

    "### Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. School density representing education quality: current analysis assumes that a higher density of education institutions (primary, secondary schools and tertiary institutions) correlates with better educational opportunities, regardless the actual quality or performance of those institutions.\n",
    "2. Relatively static analysis over time: current analysis is based on data from 2023, making assumption that the educational landscape remains mostly stable, where factors like funding, policies, or development in infrastructure do not undergo major changes\n",
    "3. Influence of non-academic factors: it is assumed that residents of the suburb have full access to schools within that suburb, where other factors such as catchment zones, private versus public school policies are not taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ranking criteria differences across school stages: ranking primary and secondary schools together is challenging since their educational objectives and outcomes differ. A secondary school's ranking might influence real estate more significantly due to its relevance to ATAR/VCE scores, while primary schools often lack performance-based rankings. Tertiary instituions are often highly selective and profession specific in the courses provided, and rankings are hard to make as delivered content is varied. Hence, education density is used to identify top suburbs instead\n",
    "2. Quality vs. Quantity dilemma: the use of \"education density\" measures the quantity of schools but fails to account for the quality of education provided by each institution. A suburb with many low-performing schools could appear more favorable than one with fewer but higher-performing schools."

An example of this would be Quandong - in 2023 there are 12000 people, and in 2027 there are predicted to be around 14000 but the shading is lighter."
