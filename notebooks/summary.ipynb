    "\n",
    "The senior secondary achievements dataset was used to rank secondary schools based on study scores and completion percentages. For primary schools, a ranking was generated by comparing enrollment percentages relative to the population size of each suburb.\n",
    "Then a suburb ranking was compiled based on educational institution counts and primary and secondary school rankings to create a comprehensive feature dataset. This final feature set integrates different facets of education within each suburb, providing holistic view of educational availability and is intended to be included in the feature set for prediction model fitting.\n",

    "    1. Suburb rankings by education density\n",

    "    3. Suburb rankings by primary school density\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 20 suburbs were highlighted in each plot as a metric to evaluate the performance across these three criteria. However, given the varying nature of educational stages, these rankings differ across plots. Ultimately, the objective is to identify 'high-performing' suburbs that excel in education density, primary school quality, and secondary school rankings. Such suburbs could potentially influence rental prices, as the availability and quality of education are often key factors for families and renters when choosing a location.\n",

    "## Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "### Education\n",
    "Assumptions: \n",
    "1. Whether education density represents education quality: current analysis assumes that a higher density of education institutions (primary, secondary schools and tertiary institutions) correlates with better educational opportunities, regardless of the actual performance of said institutions.\n",
    "2. Relatively static analysis over time: current analysis is based on data from 2023 and assumes that the educational landscape remains relatively stable across the years, where factors like funding, policies, or development in infrastructure do not encounter major changes.\n",
    "3. Influence of non-academic factors: the presence of a school in a suburb assumes that residents have access to it, the current analysis does not take into account restrictions regarding catchment zones, private versus public school policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "1. Ranking criteria differences across schooling stages: ranking educational institutions together is challenging since their educational objectives and outcomes differ - hence top suburbs can only be identified through density and not institutional performance. Real estate might be influenced more significantly by secondary schools' rankings due to its relevance to ATAR/VCE scores, while primary schools often lack performance-based rankings. Tertiary instution rankings can be highly specialised in selective fields and course based hence ranking also difficult.\n",
    "2. Dilemma - quality vs. quantity: using \"education density\" measures the quantity of schools but doesnt account for the quality of education provided by each institution. A suburb with many low-performing schools could appear more favorable than one with fewer but higher-performing schools."
