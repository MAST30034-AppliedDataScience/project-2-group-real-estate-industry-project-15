    "## Urban Landmarks \n",
    "\n",
    "To perfrom an anlaysis for the urban landmarks across Victoria and their impact on median rental prices, we used five different datasets/shapefiles. These datasets are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Land Use Data**\n",
    "    * E.g. industrial areas, retail areas, residential areas etc.\n",
    "* **Natural Areas Data** \n",
    "    * E.g. parks, beaches, cliffs etc.\n",
    "* **Places of Worship Data** \n",
    "    * E.g. churches, mosques etc.\n",
    "* **Urban Places Data** \n",
    "    * E.g. shopping centres, libraries, supermarkets etc.\n",
    "* **Roads Data** \n",
    "    * E.g. main roads, toll roads, walking paths etc.\n",

    "### Analysis of the Impact of Land Use in Victoria on Rental Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"../plots/urban_landmarks_visualisations/Landuse_VIC.png\" alt=\"Land Use in Victoria\" style=\"width: 70%;\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the map above, it can be seen that a vast majority of the regional areas in Victoria are occupied by forests, nature reserves and parks or farmland. In particular, the north-western regions of Victoria are characterised by extensive farmlands, while the eastern regions are largely covered by dense forests. In contrast, metropolitan Melbourne is predominantly composed of residential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Horsham, a suburb in the north-western area of regional Victoria has a median rental price of $280 p/w. \n",
    "* Wangaratta, a suburb in the eastern side of regional Victoria has a median rental price is $300 p/w. \n",
    "* Melbourne, the heart of Victoria that contains the most residential areas has a median rental price is $504 p/w. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, suburbs with more farmland and natural areas contain cheaper rental properties than the built-up areas in metropolitan Melbourne. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a closer look into metropolitan Melbourne, we can see that majority of the land cover is mostly attributed to residential areas. In the western suburbs, there is visibly a larger number of industrial areas which highlights the increasing development of residential properties in those areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For western suburbs such as Melton, the median rental price was $347.50 p/w.\n",
    "* For eastern suburbs, such as Wantirna, the median rental price was $446.50 p/w. \n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that industrial areas have cheaper rental properties. \n",

    "According to the 2021 Census, Christianity remains the most common religion in Australia and Victoria.

    "* **Healthcare** \n",

    "* **Culture and Leisure** \n",
    "    * E.g. Town Halls, museums etc. \n",

    "* **Tourism and Attractions** \n",
    "    * E.g. Lookouts, beaches etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Melbourne CBD is quite an all-rounded suburb in terms of containing the most public facilities, food and beverage areas, retail areas and tourist spots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Majority of the east Melbourne suburbs such as Springvale, Glen Waverley, Camberwell etc. locate a good number of useful infastructure such as public faciltiies, good healthcare accesibility and faciltiies for culture and leisure. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the correlation analysis between all engineered urban landmarks features and the median rental prices across Victoria, we found that majority of the features displayed weak correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural areas such as farmland, parks (distance), neture reserves and tracks had low to moderate negative correlation.\n",
    "    * As natural areas increase, rental prices decrease. \n",
    "* Areas with beaches had a moderate positive correlation.\n",
    "    * Coastline properties are quite expensive for the views. \n",
    "    * Regions with more beaches have more expensive rental prices. \n",
    "* Public ammenities such as distances to fire stations, police stations, and supermarkets showed to have low to moderate negative correlation.\n",
    "    * The closer the propety is to these features, the more expensive the rental price. "

    "### Approach\n",
    "The senior secondary achievements dataset was used to rank secondary schools based on study scores and completion percentages. For primary schools, a ranking was generated by comparing enrollment percentages relative to the population size of each suburb.\n",

    "We compiled a suburb ranking based on the number of educational institution and the primary and secondary school rankings to create a comprehensive feature dataset.

    "3. Suburb rankings by primary school density\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 20 suburbs were highlighted in each plot as a metric to evaluate the performance across these three criteria. However, given the varying nature of educational stages, these rankings differ across plots. Ultimately, the objective is to identify 'high-performing' suburbs that excel in education density, primary school quantity, and secondary school rankings. \n",
