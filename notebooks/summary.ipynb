    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the map above, it can be seen that a vast majority of the regional areas in Victoria are occupied by forests, nature reserves and parks or farmland. In particular, the north-western regions of Victoria are characterised by extensive farmlands, while the eastern regions are largely covered by dense forests. In contrast, metropolitan Melbourne is predominantly composed of residential areas.\n",

    "* Melbourne, the heart of Victoria that contains the most residential areas has a median rental price is $504 p/w. \n",

In the western suburbs, there is visibly a larger number of industrial areas which highlights the increasing development of residential properties in those areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For western suburbs such as Melton, the median rental price was $347.50 p/w.\n",
    "* For eastern suburbs, such as Wantirna, the median rental price was $446.50 p/w. \n",

    "\n",
    "To do this, we followed the steps outlined below:\n",
    "* Create a combined feature set\n",
    "    * Merge median rental prices, our scraped data for 2024 September and our engineered feature sets \n",
    "    * Each unique property type is a different dataset (one_bed_flat, two bed_house etc.)\n",

    "    * Testing (Prediction): 2025 - 2027 (3 years)\n",
    "* Perform feature selection using recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a random forest estimator\n",
    "* Develop the model\n",
    "    * Train the model on the training set\n",
    "    * Tune the model on the validation set using cross val\n",
    "        * Scoring metric: 'neg_mean_squared_error'\n",
    "    * Find the best random forest model and retrained it on the combined training and validation sets (2016-2024)\n",

    "### Rent Vision Pro (Modelling Results)\n",

The shaded region of each trend line indicated the error margins. As shown below, the mean absolute error did not exceed $100 for any property types.

We can see that both property types gave most importance to distance to CBD as well as the income of the residents in the suburb. However flats took more focus into the number of assault crimes and distances to public transport, whereas, houses gave more focus to residential area density and number of top schools in the suburb. Both flats and houses also deemed the feature of pets allowed/not allowed to be the most important internal feature. \n",
